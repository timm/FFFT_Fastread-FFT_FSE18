% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/ifpdf
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc

  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi

\usepackage{amsmath}
\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/array


%\usepackage{mdwmath}
%\usepackage{mdwtab}
% Also highly recommended is Mark Wooding's extremely powerful MDW tools,
% especially mdwmath.sty and mdwtab.sty which are used to format equations
% and tables, respectively. The MDWtools set is already installed on most
% LaTeX systems. The lastest version and documentation is available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/mdwtools


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.


%\usepackage{eqparbox}
% Also of notable interest is Scott Pakin's eqparbox package for creating
% (automatically sized) equal width boxes - aka "natural width parboxes".
% Available at:

% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a sans serif font rather
% than the serif font used in traditional IEEE formatting and thus the need
% to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending on whether
% compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/subfig




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure.
% Be aware that LaTeX2e kernels dated 2015 and later have fixltx2e.sty's
% corrections already built into the system in which case a warning will
% be issued if an attempt is made to load fixltx2e.sty as it is no longer
% needed.
% The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/fixltx2e


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/stfloats
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as the IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that the IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as the IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/dblfloatfix


%\ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff
%  \usepackage[nomarkers]{endfloat}
% \let\MYoriglatexcaption\caption
% \renewcommand{\caption}[2][\relax]{\MYoriglatexcaption[#2]{#2}}
%\fi
% endfloat.sty was written by James Darrell McCauley, Jeff Goldberg and 
% Axel Sommerfeldt. This package may be useful when used in conjunction with 
% IEEEtran.cls'  captionsoff option. Some IEEE journals/societies require that
% submissions have lists of figures/tables at the end of the paper and that
% figures/tables without any captions are placed on a page by themselves at
% the end of the document. If needed, the draftcls IEEEtran class option or
% \CLASSINPUTbaselinestretch interface can be used to increase the line
% spacing as well. Be sure and use the nomarkers option of endfloat to
% prevent endfloat from "marking" where the figures would have been placed
% in the text. The two hack lines of code above are a slight modification of
% that suggested by in the endfloat docs (section 8.4.1) to ensure that
% the full captions always appear in the list of figures/tables - even if
% the user used the short optional argument of \caption[]{}.
% IEEE papers do not typically make use of \caption[]'s optional argument,
% so this should not be an issue. A similar trick can be used to disable
% captions of packages such as subfig.sty that lack options to turn off
% the subcaptions:
% For subfig.sty:
% \let\MYorigsubfloat\subfloat
% \renewcommand{\subfloat}[2][\relax]{\MYorigsubfloat[]{#2}}
% However, the above trick will not work if both optional arguments of
% the \subfloat command are used. Furthermore, there needs to be a
% description of each subfigure *somewhere* and endfloat does not add
% subfigure captions to its list of figures. Thus, the best approach is to
% avoid the use of subfigure captions (many IEEE journals avoid them anyway)
% and instead reference/explain all the subfigures within the main caption.
% The latest version of endfloat.sty and its documentation can obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/endfloat
%
% The IEEEtran \ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff conditional can also be used
% later in the document, say, to conditionally put the References on a 
% page by themselves.





% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/url
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.


% NOTE: PDF thumbnail features are not required in IEEE papers
%       and their use requires extra complexity and work.
%\ifCLASSINFOpdf
%  \usepackage[pdftex]{thumbpdf}
%\else
%  \usepackage[dvips]{thumbpdf}
%\fi
% thumbpdf.sty and its companion Perl utility were written by Heiko Oberdiek.
% It allows the user a way to produce PDF documents that contain fancy
% thumbnail images of each of the pages (which tools like acrobat reader can
% utilize). This is possible even when using dvi->ps->pdf workflow if the
% correct thumbpdf driver options are used. thumbpdf.sty incorporates the
% file containing the PDF thumbnail information (filename.tpm is used with
% dvips, filename.tpt is used with pdftex, where filename is the base name of
% your tex document) into the final ps or pdf output document. An external
% utility, the thumbpdf *Perl script* is needed to make these .tpm or .tpt
% thumbnail files from a .ps or .pdf version of the document (which obviously
% does not yet contain pdf thumbnails). Thus, one does a:
% 
% thumbpdf filename.pdf 
%
% to make a filename.tpt, and:
%
% thumbpdf --mode dvips filename.ps
%
% to make a filename.tpm which will then be loaded into the document by
% thumbpdf.sty the NEXT time the document is compiled (by pdflatex or
% latex->dvips->ps2pdf). Users must be careful to regenerate the .tpt and/or
% .tpm files if the main document changes and then to recompile the
% document to incorporate the revised thumbnails to ensure that thumbnails
% match the actual pages. It is easy to forget to do this!
% 
% Unix systems come with a Perl interpreter. However, MS Windows users
% will usually have to install a Perl interpreter so that the thumbpdf
% script can be run. The Ghostscript PS/PDF interpreter is also required.
% See the thumbpdf docs for details. The latest version and documentation
% can be obtained at.
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/thumbpdf


% NOTE: PDF hyperlink and bookmark features are not required in IEEE
%       papers and their use requires extra complexity and work.

%\fi
% One significant drawback of using hyperref under DVI output is that the
% LaTeX compiler cannot break URLs across lines or pages as can be done
% under pdfLaTeX's PDF output via the hyperref pdftex driver. This is
% probably the single most important capability distinction between the
% DVI and PDF output. Perhaps surprisingly, all the other PDF features
% (PDF bookmarks, thumbnails, etc.) can be preserved in
% .tex->.dvi->.ps->.pdf workflow if the respective packages/scripts are
% loaded/invoked with the correct driver options (dvips, etc.). 
% As most IEEE papers use URLs sparingly (mainly in the references), this
% may not be as big an issue as with other publications.
%
% That said, Vilar Camara Neto created his breakurl.sty package which
% permits hyperref to easily break URLs even in dvi mode.
% Note that breakurl, unlike most other packages, must be loaded
% AFTER hyperref. The latest version of breakurl and its documentation can
% be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/breakurl
% breakurl.sty is not for use under pdflatex pdf mode.
%
% The advanced features offer by hyperref.sty are not required for IEEE
% submission, so users should weigh these features against the added
% complexity of use.
% The package options above demonstrate how to enable PDF bookmarks
% (a type of table of contents viewable in Acrobat Reader) as well as
% PDF document information (title, subject, author and keywords) that is
% viewable in Acrobat reader's Document_Properties menu. PDF document
% information is also used extensively to automate the cataloging of PDF
% documents. The above set of options ensures that hyperlinks will not be
% colored in the text and thus will not be visible in the printed page,
% but will be active on "mouse over". USING COLORS OR OTHER HIGHLIGHTING
% OF HYPERLINKS CAN RESULT IN DOCUMENT REJECTION BY THE IEEE, especially if
% these appear on the "printed" page. IF IN DOUBT, ASK THE RELEVANT
% SUBMISSION EDITOR. You may need to add the option hypertexnames=false if
% you used duplicate equation numbers, etc., but this should not be needed
% in normal IEEE work.
% The latest version of hyperref and its documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/hyperref





% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.

% to submit to, of course. )

\begin{abstract}
A ``hero'' project is one where  80\% or more of the contributions are made by the 20\% of the developers. In the literature, such projects are  deprecated since they might   cause bottlenecks 
in development and communication. However, there is little empirical evidence on this matter.
Further, recent studies show that such hero projects are very prevalent.
Accordingly, 
this paper explores the effect of having heroes in project, from a code quality perspective. 
We identify  the heroes  developer 
communities in  1100+ open source GitHub projects. Based on the analysis,
we find that   (a)~hero projects are majorly all projects;  and (b)~the
commits from ``hero developers'' (who
contribute most to the code) result in far fewer bugs than other developers.  That is,
contrary
to the literature, 
heroes are standard and very useful  part of modern open source projects.


%In ``hero projects'',  80\% of the contributions are made by the 20\% of ``hero'' developers. 
%Much literature claims that such heroism should be depreciated
%since, it is argued, the open source goal is to have a large community
%working on a code base.  Such claims lack extensive empirical
%backing. Accordingly, this paper explores the value of  heroes
%in software development. Using  a social graph analysis, we can identify heroes
%as those who are most involved in the discussions about what to commit. 
%We find that in 1000+ open source GitHub projects, that (a)~hero projects 
%very common and (b)~the {\em greater} the prevalence of heroes, the {\em lower}
%the odds that a commit will result in a bug report. 
%That is, projects that make extensive use of heroes, have 
% higher code quality code.

``hero'' project is one where  80\% or more of the contributions come from 20\% of  developers.
In the literature, such  hero projects are deprecated  since, it is said,
they are   bottlenecks that slows  project development and causes information loss~\cite{bier2011online,boehm2006view,hislop2002integrating,morcovcomplex,wood2005multiview,fitzgerald2003making}. 

Recent studies have motivated a re-examination of the implications of heroes.

% needed around the contents of the optional argument to biography to prevent
% the LaTeX parser from getting confused when it sees the complicated
% \includegraphics command within an optional argument. (You could create
% your own custom macro containing the \includegraphics command to make things
% simpler here.)
%\begin{IEEEbiography}[{\includegraphics[width=1in,height=1.25in,clip,keepaspectratio]{mshell}}]{Michael Shell}
% or if you just want to reserve a space for a photo:



% You can push biographies down or up by placing
% a \vfill before or after them. The appropriate
% use of \vfill depends on what kind of text is
% on the last page and whether or not the columns
% are being equalized.

%\vfill

% Can be used to pull up biographies so that the bottom of the last one
% is flush with the other column.
%\enlargethispage{-5in}



% that's all folks
