abstract = "Context
Topic models such as probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (pLSA) and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) have demonstrated success in mining software repository tasks. Understanding software change messages described by the unstructured nature-language text is one of the fundamental challenges in mining these messages in repositories.
Objective
We seek to present a novel automatic change message classification method characterized by semi-supervised topic semantic analysis.
Method
In this work, we present a semi-supervised LDA based approach to automatically classify change messages. We use domain knowledge of software changes to make labeled samples which are added to build the semi-supervised LDA model. Next, we verify the cross-project analysis application of our method on three open-source projects. Our method has two advantages over existing software change classification methods: First of all, it mitigates the issue of how to set the appropriate number of latent topics. We do not have to choose the number of latent topics in our method, because it corresponds to the number of class labels. Second, this approach utilizes the information provided by the label samples in the training set.
Results
Our method automatically classified about 85% of the change messages in our experiment and our validation survey showed that 70.56% of the time our automatic classification results were in agreement with developer opinions.
Conclusion
Our approach automatically classifies most of the change messages which record the cause of the software change and the method is applicable to cross-project analysis of software change messages."

pages="517--536",
abstract="This paper describes a case study of software engineers developing a library of software components for a group of research scientists, using a traditional, staged, document-led methodology. The case study reveals two problems with the use of the methodology. The first is that it demands an upfront articulation of requirements, whereas the scientists had experience, and hence expectations, of emergent requirements; the second is that the project documentation does not suffice to construct a shared understanding. Reflecting on our case study, we discuss whether combining agile elements with a traditional methodology might have alleviated these problems. We then argue that the rich picture painted by the case study, and the reflections on methodology that it inspires, has a relevance that reaches beyond the original context of the study.",

pages="517--536",
abstract="This paper describes a case study of software engineers developing a library of software components for a group of research scientists, using a traditional, staged, document-led methodology. The case study reveals two problems with the use of the methodology. The first is that it demands an upfront articulation of requirements, whereas the scientists had experience, and hence expectations, of emergent requirements; the second is that the project documentation does not suffice to construct a shared understanding. Reflecting on our case study, we discuss whether combining agile elements with a traditional methodology might have alleviated these problems. We then argue that the rich picture painted by the case study, and the reflections on methodology that it inspires, has a relevance that reaches beyond the original context of the study.",

title="Finding better active learners for faster literature reviews",

abstract="Literature reviews can be time-consuming and tedious to complete. By cataloging and refactoring three state-of-the-art active learning techniques from evidence-based medicine and legal electronic discovery, this paper finds and implements FASTREAD, a faster technique for studying a large corpus of documents, combining and parametrizing the most efficient active learning algorithms. This paper assesses FASTREAD using datasets generated from existing SE literature reviews (Hall, Wahono, Radjenovi{\'{c}}, Kitchenham et al.). Compared to manual methods, FASTREAD lets researchers find 95{\%} relevant studies after reviewing an order of magnitude fewer papers. Compared to other state-of-the-art automatic methods, FASTREAD reviews 20--50{\%} fewer studies while finding same number of relevant primary studies in a systematic literature review.",
